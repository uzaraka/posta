# Features

## Email Delivery

* **HTTP Email API**
  Send single, batch, or template-based emails via REST endpoints.

* **File Attachments**
  Attach files to emails using base64-encoded content.

* **Custom Headers & Unsubscribe**
  Set custom email headers and automatic List-Unsubscribe support (URL and POST-based).

* **Scheduled Delivery**
  Queue emails for delivery at a specified time.

* **Email Preview**
  Render and preview emails without sending via the API or dashboard.

* **Email Status Polling**
  Lightweight status endpoint for tracking delivery state of individual emails.

* **Asynchronous Processing**
  Background workers process email queues using Redis and Asynq with priority tiers (transactional, bulk, and low-priority).

  Failed emails are retried automatically with configurable retry limits per SMTP server. Retry failed emails manually from the dashboard.

* **Development Mode**
  Store and preview emails in the dashboard without sending them.

---

## Templates

* **Versioned Templates**
  Create multiple template versions with a selectable active version.

* **Multi-language Support**
  Templates support language-specific versions with variable substitution.

  Stylesheets are automatically inlined for email client compatibility.

  Render and preview templates directly from the dashboard.

* **Template Import / Export**
  Export templates as JSON and import them across environments.

---

## SMTP and Domain Management

* **Multiple SMTP Servers**
  Configure multiple SMTP servers per user with SSL or STARTTLS support.

* **Shared SMTP Pool**
  Administrators can define shared SMTP servers available to all users.

  Verify domain ownership via DNS records including SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.

* **Verified Sending Enforcement**
  Optionally restrict sending to verified domains only.

---

## Security and Authentication

  Secure API keys with hashing, prefix identification, expiration, IP allowlisting, and revocation.

* **Dashboard Authentication**
  JWT-based authentication with role-based access control.

## Workspaces

* **Multi-Workspace Isolation**

  Four roles: Owner, Admin, Editor, and Viewer. Control who can create resources, manage members, or view data.

* **Member Invitations**
  Invite users by email with a specific role. Invitees can accept or decline directly from the dashboard.

* **Workspace Switcher**
  Switch between your personal space and workspaces from the sidebar. All resources, analytics, and stats are scoped to the active context.

* **Data Transfer**
  Transfer personal resources (templates, contacts, SMTP servers, API keys, etc.) into a workspace.

* **Workspace-Scoped API Keys**
  API keys created in a workspace context are automatically scoped to that workspace.

---

## Events and Webhooks

  Track delivery attempts, HTTP status codes, retry counts, and response details per webhook.

* **Configurable Retries**
  Set max retries and request timeout per webhook with exponential backoff.

* **Audit Logs**
  Track platform and user activity with filtering and real-time streaming using Server-Sent Events.

---

## Analytics and Monitoring

  View daily email volume and status breakdown with date filtering.

* **Dashboard Statistics**
  Delivery rate trends, bounce rate graphs, and latency percentiles.

* **Daily Reports**
  Opt-in daily email reports with sent/failed counts and delivery rate per user.

* **Prometheus Metrics**
  Export metrics including request counts, latencies, email delivery counters, and webhook delivery stats.

* **Health Probes**
  Liveness (`/healthz`) and readiness (`/readyz`) endpoints.

---
